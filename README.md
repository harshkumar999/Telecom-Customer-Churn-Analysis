# ðŸ“Š Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze telecom customer churn using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to derive actionable insights that can help telecom companies retain their customers.

## Business Understanding
Telecom companies face a significant challenge in retaining their customers. By understanding the factors that contribute to customer churn, companies can take proactive steps to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.


## Dataset
- The dataset includes various attributes related to telecom customers, such as demographic information, service usage details, account information, and churn status.


## Data Cleaning
- TotalCharges Conversion: Converted TotalCharges from string to numeric. Identified and ignored 11 missing values (0.15% of the dataset).


## Key Insights
### Univariate Analysis
- Analyzed the distribution of individual features to understand their characteristics.

### Bivariate Analysis
- Identified relationships between features and their impact on churn.

## Final Thoughts
- Non-Senior Citizens are more likely to churn.
- Single individuals, especially single women, have higher churn rates.
- Monthly contracts see higher churn due to the lack of long-term commitment.
